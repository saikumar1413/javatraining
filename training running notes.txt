>>we cant exceed the size
>>we cant store mixed  datatypes in array
>>array will have index

to access element in an array, we use below syntax
>>syntax: <datatype> variablename[size];

>>in arrays length is property, it is not a function 
bbecause while using length in code we dont specify braces therefore it is called as property

PACKAGE:
---------
>a package is a colection of classes,interfaces,abstract,variables and methods

>packages are of 2 types
1) user defined 2) pre defined
>any package which is part of your jdk is called as pre defined

System.exit()
system is class and exit is static method

System.out.println()
out is a static reference and mode
printl() is a method

memory will be allocated for an class once you create object

method with body is called as concrete method
method without body is called as abstract method


Syntax: to create object
---------

<classname> reference=new <classname>();

ex: stat ref = new stat();

new is mainly used for memory allocation

>always initialize reference with null, we are not allowing


when it is static method we call using class name
non static  using object

>>constructor
-----------

>is a method whose name is same as class name
>used to initialize class level variables
>it wont return any values
> it will be within class
> 3types
1) parametarized
2)empty or unparametarized
3)default construction

>if developer is not providing any constructor, then JVM will 
provide default constructor
note:by using return  we can return more than one value using array

>this always points to current

overloading and overriding
-------------------------------------
overloading

>overloading means same name with different types and no of parameters 
and if possible return types 

>overloading occurs in same class
>the overloaded method must change the argument list (number of parameters, 
data type, or sequence of parameters).
>The overloaded method can change the return type.
>The overloaded method can change the access modifier (the signature
 of the function should be different).
 
 
>>overriding

> means same function but in different classes

[12:35 PM] Srinivas (Guest)

Rules for Method Overiding:

===========================

>the argument list should be exactly the same as that of the overridden method.

The return type should be the same or a subtype of the return type 
declared in the original overridden method in the superclass.

The access level cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method's 
access level. For example: If the superclass method is declared public 
then the overriding method in the subclass cannot be either private or
 protected.

Instance methods can be overridden only if they are inherited by the 
subclass.

A method declared final cannot be overridden.

A method declared static cannot be overridden but can be re-declared.

If a method cannot be inherited, then it cannot be overridden.

A subclass within the same package as the instance's superclass can 
override any superclass method that is not declared private or final.

A subclass in a different package can only override the non-final methods 
declared public or protected.

An overriding method can throw any uncheck exceptions, regardless of
whether the overridden method throws exceptions or not. However, the 
overriding method should not throw checked exceptions that are new or
broader than the ones declared by the overridden method. The overridng
method can throw narrower or fewer exceptions than the overridden method.

Constructors cannot be overridden.

Inheritance
-----------

>any class which is declared with final is cannot inherited
>NOTE:a class can be private only in inner class
>in java, for every class, object is the base class
>obj can be cloned using clone().clone means copy

Types of inheritancein java
----------------------------
1)single
2)multi level 
3)hierarchial 
4)multiple--but in java it dont support directly

>>A class extends class.
>>An interface can extends interface


Interfaces and Abstract Classes
----------------------------------
Abstract method has no body
>abstract class contains abstract methods
>2 types abstarct classes
1) pure abstract only abstract methods
2) partially abstract- we will have both abstract and concrete methods
interface--->abstract class---->concrete class

Interface:Interface------An interface is similar like class but with abstract methods.
>>We cannot create object for interface.
>by deafult all methods  in interfaces  are abstract
>any class can implement interface
>@override is called as annotation .
>



COLLECTIONS
---------------
---------------

>>can grow and shrink. 
collections are primarily defined through a set of interfaces
>>supported by a set of classes that implement the interface.

>>>1)LIST

>list is an interface. it allows duplicates
>we can add/modify/delete objects
> All drawbacks in arrays can be overcome by lists

a)Arraylist
>Arraylist maintains insertion order
>it allows duplicates also.
>to convert arraylist to array use .toArray
>iterator is mainly used for displaying data in collection .it was 
specially designed for that 
>bydefault all the collections will implement 

>>foreach syntax cloneable, serializable

for(<target> ref:source)
{
}


>>>VECTOR
-----------
>>Vector is synchronized and arraylist is asynchronized


>>>SET Interface
--------------------
> set will not allow duplicates
>HASHSET
--------
>no ordering of elements
>add,remove, and contains methods constant time complexity O(c)

>TREESET
----------
redering of elements

>>>MAP
------------
------------
>>HASHMAP
-------------
>map will allow keys and values. no 2 keys should be same
NOTE>Test collections using null and ""

>no ordering of elements


>>TREEMAP
---------------
>ordering of elements



EXCEPTION HANDLING
--------------------
---------------------

>any abnormal condition in program leads to error msgs or termination of program
to deal with this we are going tof use exception handling
>Syntax
try
{
}
catch(Exception e)
{
}
finally
{
}
 even though there is error finally block will be executed
 try--catch/finally
 try--finally
 >finnaly cannot be nested
 

we should not write jdbc and hybernet code in try and catch
>all predefined exception extends "Throwable"

DAY6:(Advance Java)
========================================
day 6-JDBC, day 7&8 Servlets, day9-JSP, day 10-JSP +JDBC or
Servlets+jdbc(integrations and do and dont's in jsp and servlets )


>>>JDBC
-----------
mysql pwd:mysql123@

create database training;
show database;
use training; //Switching among the databases

if pwd is wrong--services.msc is a command to check mysql is 
running or not

>>API?
---------
API stands for application programming interface
An api is combination of classes, methods, interfaces designed for
specific purpose.
>Every API has some set rules defined

>Mainly API's are used for connecting 2 or more different systems,
terminals,machines ,pc or machines or application


>API's are of 2types
1)pre defined--vendor
2)user defined

App1(java)----------------App2(.Net)---API

>in simple it makes "API calls" on backend
customer-----server----chef


>>>JDBC stands for java database connectivity.
------------
>jdbc gives us api's that can access any kind of RDBMS database
> i want save some data to the backend database
from frontend, then i can use JDBC
>>RDBMS databases: oracle,mysql,postgresql, db2 .....
>to desing any application using JDBC, we need to have below S/ws.
1)Database2
2)Datasource
3)JDBC API
4) Database tables-- we r going to create employee table
5)Java programming language

Employee----->fullname,idno,department

create table empolyee(fullname char(50),idno integer,department(80));

desc table employee;---displays meta data



>Eclipse+Tomat integrations
> JDBC is an api to connect backend database/systems

>ODBC>>>>>>>JDBC>>>>JPA(Hibernet)

>>JPS initially uses jdbc.
>>ODBC----open database connectivity

>odbc is old technology which is designed using c/c++.
because of this is platform dependent.
> odbc is mainly used for microsoft technologies like microsoft access ,excel, wordpad ... etc...
>odbc dont support remote database.

>only browser knows how to interact with server
no otehr component ion in world knows how  to interact with server effectively
>Protocols: http/https
>browser will perform HTTP requests and HTTP response

>in java if any app want to communicate with database , it uses JDBC driver.
>browser is also called as useragent,it is alias name.
>browser knows only http/https protocols.

>Browser--->Type ur URL--->click hit button----->As sson 
as i click next--->http request will be created and will be
forwared to DNS server--->from there request will be 
redirected to Microserver server---->it will check whether
username is valid by interacting with microsoftdatabase---
->if record is available/unavailable gives response to 
server---->filter----->browser

>request response architecture
>>java application , i want to push my data to db for storing
sol: JDBC/Hibernate

>in this JDBC we need to focus on
in jdbc we are having 4types od drivers

Driver: is a software written in any lanuguage which 
converts one form of function call into another form of 
function call

1)JDBC-ODBC bridge driver type-10-JSP
2)Native API driver(partially java driver)
3)Network protocol driver(fully java driver)
4)Thin driver(fully java driver)


in jdbc we use java.sql and java.sqlx.packages.
x stands dor extensions ie latest package or 
upgraded package from oracle.


>>>>DB connection pooling
-----------------
heavyweight=more memory
light weight=less memory


>DB connection object is a heavy weight. we should know how to
utilize db resources properly. otherwise  hnadling more customer traffic will be difficult
>DB connection pooling will reduce burden on database.it use the
connectionresources in the effective way of reusability


DAY7
==============================================================
JDBC API
--------
>mysql server---DB
>mysql workbench----IDE--rapid tool--- we can  also connect to remote database
>Centralized DB
>Distributed DB
>Transaction---->commit and rollback


>For API development and testing,there are so many tools.
search---sample api for postman------click on rapid api.com
openAPI is most used public api
>Now postman is also called as openAPI


APP---------------JDBC Driver----------------DB

APP layer:developer uses api to make calls to DB via SQL 


>>Datasource:
>Every connection to a database is called as session.
>Example: 3 apps are connecting to same DB
>session will be invalidated.

session1-----going on-----db----9
session2 -----going on----db---9.02
i made changes in db--------9:03
sessionis most important and sensitive


Steps
-----
Loading driver
establishing connection
creating statements
executing statements queries
handle result
close connection

for developer , it is request but for server it is thread

TASKS
-------------
Task:Explore sticky session
Task:insert, update, delete and inserting data should be dynamic
using jdbc 
Task:explore ResultSet








>phising filter is a chrome filter to protect from unauthorized access

>Mysql for learning
>mysql workbench ---for projects and development
>Alternative tools for mysql workbench 
Eclipse datasource feature,toad for mysql(dell toad),..etc


>dont download jar files using java2s website
>dont download beta and alpha and snapshot versions because it is under testing
>Ga-- general availability---download softwares if it is GA
>in projects we will use corporate repositories. IT team
will place all dependencies in a common corporate repositry

purpose is called as corporate repository
>Tool we are going to use NEXUS SONATYPE/Jfrog repository managers --used to create
>corporate repository
>IT will perform jar scanning. for vulnarabilities.
>network that we create fo rinternal purpose of an organization
is called INTRANET

>>MAVEN TOOL
----------------
>dependency management tool/build tool
>GRADLE is tough competator for marven
>MAVEN is inbuilt in eclipse.
>PKIX is a ssr certicate 


>>ping 10.4.7.97 is a command in cmd used to connect other system

>ResultSet is mainly called as cursor or container to store 
the records after executing sql query stmnt.

>Table is also called as entity
>rows are called as records


>>Related to database to display data
ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY
ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE
ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE


Concurrency of ResultSet--- to modify the ResultSet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY  --- creates a read only result set.this is default

Drawbacks:

 

1)Make the values insert at runtime.

Solution)Use PreparedStatement

 

2)connection closing shld be in final.Final will run irrespective of exceptions in the  code.

Solution)Can be handled in code.

 

3)Not portable

Solution)USe properties or XML files.

 

4)password shld not disclosed in code.

solution)if we need to use the password in code,encrypty the password and then use.

2)Place password in VAULT server or AWS Secrets manager  and pull password from  there.(prefered).
Integrate vault code with JAva code.

3)USe properties file and place your encrypted password in properties or xml or YAML file.

5)driver class,url and passwords should be dynamic.

solution)can be achieved using 4 the step.

 >>>>>LOB datatypes
 ----------------------------------
 >LOB stands for large objects
 >LOB is of 3 types
 
 1)Blob--- binary large object  ex-images,audio...etc
 2)clob---character large object  ex-documents...etc
 3)nclob---n no of character large objects

>>callable statement:used for calling functions/ stored procedures in db


>>Prepared statement:
------------------------
>this is mainly for inserting values to the queries at runtime
>prepared statement helps us to avoid SQL injection upto som extent 80%

>server takes care responsibilities for running servelett


2 types of server
1)web 2) application
1)web
>tomcat
>nginx
>jetty 

2)application
>Glassfish
>weblogic
>websphere

web server have HTTP engine(s/w)
				+catalina(container that runs servlet programs)
				+jasper (container  for jSP programs)
				+middleware services(min 6 ) 
>middleware means server--it will do additional tasks
ex--lifecycle management,connection pooling,tx management,JNDI services
ex:apache tomcat

DAY 10:
=============================================================

Troubleshooting techniques
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1)check ypur web.xml file for syntax issues and servlet names and url patterns are matching
2) metadata is casesensitive
3)format your code or web.xml when needed
4)if more no of apps are deployed to server, better to clean 
your tomcat directories frequently
4)stop your server before shutdown your machine
5)port conflict issue -- if two services are using same port 
6)check all your servlets and jsp metadata properly in code and web.xml
7)always servlets should be reided in packages. dont use  defaultpackages
8) html and jsp file should be reside in webcontent folder or 
create a folder in webcontent and place your files there .we always developers
to create folder for html,css,js,jsp,image,and fonts
>>>even afer performing above steps,if you are still facing issues
pls, restart your IDE

java bean
DAO
Filter
JSP

>>>JAVA Bean/POJO>>>>>
pojo--playing old java object
a pojo class is a class which follows below rules
.class should be public
.no main method
.pojo classes should be in different packages and no default
.variables should be private
.method should be public
.for every variable we need to have setter and getter(public)
.And pojo class should not implement interfaces
.pojo class extend only object
.no abstract methods
.dont write db code in pojo
.we can have userdefined methods with little logic(ex overriding)
.pojo classes mainly used in layered architecture

>>>>DAO(design patterns>>>>>>>
design access object --- it is related to best practice and backend(db)
DAO is one of the design patterns
db connection (helper methods)
.create
update
delete
select
select all
insert
insert all


>we can write businness logic
>in dao logic is related to db only
>always make connection obj reusable
>all methods should be public
>always dao classes related code will be in different packages
com(or)arg.company/org/project modulename


>>>>JSP(java server pages>>>>>
every jsp will convert into servlet
jsp
|
servlet
|
bytecode

jsp is scrpting language
webpage development is done using jsp
we can write businnesslogic in jsp but it is viloation of rule 
so write frontend and backend codes differently

DAY-15 (4th week)
==============================================================================================================================
maven is a build tool  or automation build tool
package the app
repo management
transitive dependencies management
dependency managemnet
plugin management


graddle is the competator in  maven java

war--web archieve --- working on servlet
ear--eneterprise archieve  --- working on ejb
jar-- java archieve -- working on java 

the above are the packaging the app

in maven we have so many plug ins

Transitive dependency

in maven dependency means only jar file 
dependency A(parent)
dependency B(child) 

composition in oops -- a parent class have object of 
child class is called as composition.

types of repositories
---------------------------
corporate repository --in organzation --secure-- available 
in intranet --
local -- in ur machine -- it created by maven --secure but
not distributable medium secure
remote --
public -- vendors for public use -- not secure -- it is in internet 
which can accessed by anyone


maven uses two types of configuration files
pom.xml 
setting.xml 

 maven 1st check it local machine--- pom.xml -- local repository
if it is not available it will come int0 corporate repositary

 
to create corporate repository we use sonartype or jfrog

maven versions:
1.X,2.X,3.X

we are using 3 version

every project will have pom.xml file --- local
every workspace will have only 1 setting.xml ---global

a project can also have 2 pom.xml files as pom level inheritance


DAY16
=========================================================
org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-resources-plugin:2.6 or one
of its dependencies could not be resolved: Failed to read 
artifact descriptor for org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-

maven-resources-plugin:2.6

for above problem the solution is below
sol: right click on project-go to maven-update- click 
on force updatation of snpashot--click on okay

>>by default when we create a project ,maven will create 
a local repositary. its name is .m2

>.m2 will be created by maven automatically.
>maven has 2 types of configuration files
>pom.xml -- local to project
>setting.xml --i sglobal to all project running in workspace

Task
--------
>You are working on SCM project. you need to use JFREECHART
feature in your code
>DTD features and roles in development 
mostly banks use ejb technology
conja-- ejb--spring--
framework is a collection of tools,libraries,packages,modules 
thar are reqiured to build enterprise web application

spring will use either maven or gradle

pivotal cloud


Spring core
----------------------------

configuration -xml,json,javaclass,properties files,annotations
constructors
funcions
dependency injection

configuration is a metadeta

Annotations
--------------
xml used before existance of annotations
drawback of xml ARE more time for parsing,impact on performance
more xml files more impact on systems
from servletts 3.0 we have annotation instead of .xml 
from jdk 1.5 annotaions are available
represented using @

>predefined annotation
>userdefined annotations
1.compile time
2.runtime 
syntax :@webservlet

class A
{
B.objectnull;
A()
{
obj=new B();
obj.display();
}
}
class B
{
public void display()
{
sop("B")
}
}

spring supports the following configurations
xml
javaclass or javaconfig based configurations
annotation

dependency injection container (DI Injection)
for this we need to download spring

dependencies are available in configuration files

antibodies-dependencies
injection -configuration file
doctor --spring (inversion of control (IOC) container)
person --class

config files,class,dependent classes, IOC container

in spring,name of the configuration file is 
"applicationcontext.xml" 

https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/4.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/xsd-configuration.html

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> --prolog

>in majority of xml files we will have DTD(document type 
defination)
>xsi?
>xmlns?

instead of applicationcontext.xml we created sample.xml
in spring bean means pojo class
every pojo class wil have properties
we need to create setters and getters via config file
,we are going to push the data

steps:
----------
create a maven project without archetype
create package and create a bean class with required properties
cretae xml file in src/resources folder
create a java class to test the IOC or dependency injection
clean the build project
run the java main class

create a new project for injecting below values
todays date,name,city


DAY 17

Integer--wrapper class

collections supported by spring 3.X version
---------------------------------------------
list
map
set

single ton is a scope and it is default scope

quickstart -- desktop -- normal java project
webapp ---web project --dynamic web project

archetype in maven -- 

groupid--package name
articaft id -- project name

scafffolding - process of creating the project based on 
requiremnets



in setting.xml it store
proxy information -proxy server ipaddress,portno,username,pwd
common repositories
corporate repo info ---repo ip address ,port no,usernaem,pwd 
plug in info


steps to 
----------
1.create a maven project
2.add spring dependencies to pom.xml
3.clean install the maven -- when you add dependencies to 
pom.xml you need clean install the maven
4.force update maven if dependenciesare no appearing in 
dependencies hierarchial after clean install also
5.create a java package and a new bean class
6.create a applicationcontext.xml file under src/resources
fill the xml file as per requirements
<bean id="ab"  class="">
<property name="aa" value=22/>
</bean>
bean id can be anything but no twoo bean id should not be same
7.create testclass or main class
8.initiate IOC container in man class using 
"ClassPathXMLApplicationcontext"
9.get the bean and call the required getter methods
10.container should be shutdowned for which we are 
calling "shutdownhook".
 
 Shutdownhook:
---------------------
car--keys
IOC--config

forceshutdown will not happen,if we use shutdownhook it 
shutdown smoothly 
release memory/clean up the resources in proper way

in maven to give dynamic values we use${key}

list,map ,set are collections supported in spring

only in collections we use generics

generics are used to restrict the some type of datatypes
syntax:  <String>

spring core + spring mvc == to build web application

Factory design pattern,factory method

A obj=new A();

Spring MVC -- can design web app
--------------
in mvc we use annotations
MVC--model view controller

to design simple web app
html+css(SAAS)+javascript or JSP 
corba,ejb,struts,spring--are technologiesto develop web app
the above hierarcy from past

spring mvc follows mvc architecture or design pattern

controller can be servlet,jsp,filter
view can be htm,jsp,or any web technology
model can be jdbc,hibernet

there are 2 types of architecture
1.mvc1
2.mvc2

view
|
contoller
|
model

in mvc1 controller will be jsp
in mvc2 controller will be servlets

spring uses mvc2 
in mvc main controller is only 1 but child controller are many
dispatcher controller is also called front controller or front runners

spring mvc follows  request response architecture


steps: in mvc
----------------
1)Client requests for a page by specifying the Web URL for the page. E.g. https://skolaparthi.com
2)Client request is intercepted by the Dispatcher Servlet also known as Front Controller. Dispatcher Servlet is a servlet 
specified in Web.XML file (for XML Based configurations) or in the Web Configuration class (for java based configurations).
3)Dispatcher Servlet uses URL Mapping Handler to find out the relevant controller class to which request should be passed for 
subsequent processing. For example, If you have a Controller defined for all requests by specifying “/” in the URL, all requests
will be entertained by that controller.
4)Once Dispatcher Servlet has identified the Controller to be considered, it passes the client request to the controller.
5)The controller class is the main class controlling the business logic flow once request has been dispatched it it by 
dispatcher servlet. This class will implement the methods for different type of http requests (e.g. GET, POST) and all logic to 
call Service layer methods will reside in this controller class.
6)The controller class will also be responsible for returning the ModelAndView object back to the dispatcher servlet after 
getting all business logic executed and any data returned from DAO layer. ModelAndView object returned by the controller back 
to the controller specified both view and model objects.


Controller class is annotated by @Controller annotation.
 

7)After receiving ModelAndView object from the controller, Dispatcher Servlet now sends model object to view resolver to get 
the name of the view which needs to be rendered.
8)Once the view to be rendered has been identified, Dispatcher Servlet passes model object to the view. Model object contains 
the data which needs to be displayed in the view. View will be rendered with the model data. Views can be designed in any
front-end technology.
9)This view is returned to the client and client can see the view and associated data on his browser.

DAY (week5)
========================================================
Connection Pooling -- group of connection objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
pooling--group of resources

in development we call connection pooling is a middleware service

two types of connection pooling mechanism
1.server side -- by default have we connection pooling
2.client side or vendor --we need to use third party jars -- some vendors are c3po,dbcp,hikari

connection pooling size is n-1 of db size(n)

Atomic datatypes

jmeter -- used to know difference b/w jdbc and hikari
used in load testing
WEB SERVICE and network and db testing


1: add hikari dependencies to pom.xml
2)create a Hikariconfig object and provide necessary metadata.
3)pass config as parameter to datasource.

Spring AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming)
---------------------------------
it is a method or approach to design lossely 
coupled component
The main purpose of aop to inject middleware 
services to the programms
Aop is not a part of spring but we can use with spring
it can be used with any oop language

Spring+AOP

Any module(like core,mvc,springboot) of spring can use aop

AOP is used for Middleware service
middleware services examples -connection pooling,
transaction management,logging

below methods dhould be give as input to aop 
Decide where to run
at which method we need to run log

Aop will take support of spring bean container and 
perform operations


Aspect -- @Aspect common class 
join point -- where to run 
Advice--before or after
pointcut -- to match using regular expressions

Aspect: A modularization of a concern that cuts 
across multiple classes. Transaction management 
is a good example of a crosscutting concern in 
enterprise Java applications. In Spring AOP, 
aspects are implemented by using regular classes
 (the schema-based approach) or regular classes 
 annotated with the @Aspect annotation (the 
 @AspectJ style).

Join point: A point during the execution of a 
program, such as the execution of a method or 
the handling of an exception. In Spring AOP, a 
join point always represents a method execution.

Advice: Action taken by an aspect at a particular
join point. Different types of advice include 
"around", "before", and "after" advice. (Advice 
types are discussed later.) Many AOP frameworks,
including Spring, model an advice as an 
interceptor and maintain a chain of interceptors
around the join point.

Pointcut: A predicate that matches join points. 
Advice is associated with a pointcut expression 
and runs at any join point matched by the 
pointcut (for example, the execution of a method 
with a certain name). The concept of join points 
as matched by pointcut expressions is central to 
AOP, and Spring uses the AspectJ pointcut 
expression language by default.

spring aop only supports method execution join types

repeated code is called as boilerplate code

prog
in advice name of the aspect is advicetest
point-cut --selectAll
Blogic method ---implement business logic


Write advices in separate class
write businees logic in separate class
test in another class


SpringAop program structure
---------------------------------
1)pom.xml
2)create applicationcontext.xml ---write aop aspect 
3)create a class with ur middleware method
4)create an aspect class @Aspect
5)Create test class


Transaction Managment
----------------------------
transaction-collection of changes or events on DB

Every transaction has two states
1)commit
2)Rollback

phantom read
dirty read


platformTransactionmanager
transactiondefination
trasactionstatus
savepointmanager

table creation shld be automatic
ORM
sql
cache
cascading rules
relationships
To achieve this we need use JPA((Java Persistence API)--java 
specification standards

hibernate is implementor for JPA specification

ibatis,toplink are big competators for hibernate

in orm we can convert pojo class to table and vice-versa

apache persistance api

Hiberanate gave hql(hibernate query language)

hql is independent
it give cache and have 1st level(default),2nd level 
caching(3rd party) 3rd party tools --memcache,
EH cache,swarn cache,hazelcat,reddis... 
rlationships,keys
orm 
it supports collections

there are 2 ways
1.xml
2.annotaions
1.xml 
hibernate cfg xml file
pojo
mapping file xml
test class

session,tx

hibernate supports only rdbms databases

mongodb-nosql-to support this use hibernate 
ogm(object grid mapper) -it provides jpa support
 for nosql 

 
 sqlalchemy orm for python
 
hibernate validator for validations

junit, testng are unit testing frameworks
  

jboss maven integrations,hibernate tools

6.3 is the latest version of hibernate 

4.x is the version of hibernate we are using

Date t =new java.util.Date();
t.settime

dialect means ur working on hibernate

Steps in hiberante
-----------------------------------
1)Create a config object and load cfg metadata into memory.
2)Using config object,get session factory object.
3)from sessionfactory object,fetch session and open that
session with database.
4)Once connection is established,initiate tx.
5)perform db operations
6)tx shld be commited
7)close session with db.

there are two types of objects in hibernate
persistant ,transient objects


create multi-module maven project in eclipse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dzvbz36Hqu0


Hibernate object lifecycle
--------------------------
if we want to insert multiple objects into table
collections
loops
batch

life cycle of hibernate session can be divided into 
states
transient
persistent or managed --permanent storage
detached
removed


objects reside in heap memory 
only local variables store in stack

the 1st line in the xml file is called prolog

named queries
Serialization
deserialization
criteria api
HQL

inheritance in hibernate
cache
relationships

>>>Serialization --paused in game --process of 
saving  sbi of an object to a storage medium
>>>deserialization(exserialization) ---resume in game --process of 
restoring  sbi of an object to a actual stage.

state behaviour identity(SBI)

named queries
---------------
a.java
@NamedQuery(queries="select * from infinite")
executequery(queries);
b.java
queries
c.java
queries

named queries -- giving name to query and calling
with that name in another class and using it 
and it make simple 

we can place commonly executed queries in xml
or use annotaion @NamedQuery

Criteria API --this is mainly for select
this are the frequently used in sql
corelated subqueries,nestedqueries,join,keys,
where clause,having,b/w,in,like,order,groupby,
rollup,qube

rollup and qube ---use in data analytics ,pivotal
chart creation

file upload--libraries used are Apache poi+Hibernate
https://poi.apache.org/

<input type="file"/>

Write a springmvc application ,which should allow 
you to upload only pdf files to db table
note:springmvc+hibernate+commons/apachepoi

for other file formats,it should display"this type 
of file is not supported"
file size shld not exceed>1MB

---------------
list cats=session.createcriteria("cat.class")
.add(Retsrictions.like("name","IZ%")
.add(Restrictions.gt("weight",new float(wt))
 
 
 in hql for inserting values at runtime is called 
binds variable 
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.3/reference/en/html/queryhql.html

table columns and pojo columns count should match 
if names are not matching in hql,then it will 
throw error messages
if there is parent child relationships,then dml 
operation will fail.

Spring Boot+MVC2+Hibernate+Log4j+Junit+Hikari+
Dao+Layered Approaches in dev


Springboot supports uber jar architectures
uber jar means jar with jar
in main jar all child jars will be appended and 
downloaded into ur m2 repository.this will be 
avoided 90% of the maven dependency issues

spingboot provides embedded server.so no need to 
download tomcat and configure in eclipse
 
springboot is mainly used for designing cloud
based applications and microservices app development

springboot+spring cloud

>you shld be able to deploy springboot 
application to AWS cloud/Dockers

> To design a webservice, we need to write 
atleast 50 lines.But if we use springboot,
within 5 lines we can completed

>>to design a springboot app,below are the ways
1)using EClipse -- gradle/maven) --recommended way
2}using spring initializer --https://start.spring.io/
3)using springboot cli
4)manual approach
5)https://spring.io/tools

LAyered approach in spring or springboot

presentation layer --@Controller
service layer/business layer @Service
persistent layer @Repository--DAO
interacts with db

       @Component
@Controller   @Service  @Repository	   

@Controller -> Classes annotated with this, are 
intended to receive a request from the client 
side. The first request comes to the Dispatcher 
Servlet, from where it passes the request to the 
particular controller using the value of 
@RequestMapping annotation.
@Service -> Classes annotated with this, are 
intended to manipulate data, that we receive 
from the client or fetch from the database. All 
the manipulation with data should be done in this
layer.
@Repository -> Classes annotated with this, are 
intended to connect with database. It can also be
considered as DAO(Data Access Object) layer. 
This layer should be restricted to CRUD (create,
retrieve, update, delete) operations only. If 
any manipulation is required, data should be 
sent be send back to @Service layer.

to change port in springboot write port in 
application.properties as -- server.port=9090

in spring boot, spring application class will 
bootstarp the current class as per the loading 
strategy(lazy,early)

deprecated methods are the methods which are no 
longer in use or dont use for production environments

these methods failed in testing but still it work 
upto some extent,but for product,it will fail

@SpringBootApplication is combination of 
@Configuration+@EnableAutoConfiguration+

BOILER PLATE Code
-------------------
>While developing a project in Java, we tend to 
repeat the similar kind of code for each class we 
create. Such kind of repetitive code is generally 
called boilerplate code.

com.infinite.SpringBootMvc

springboot manages dispatcher servlet by using 
starters and autoconfigurations we dont need to specify any
dipather servlet

in place of properties file we can create yaml file
so that any programming language can understand yaml files

while we working on docker  with springboot , we need 
configure several docker parameters in springboot.
otherwise we cant integrate  docker with springboot


Scheduling in springboot
--------------------

> we will use schedulers.this is used mainly to perform as task 
based on event.
>when ever an event is fired, some action should be 
performed.
>on the last working day of month arises,then salary should 
be credited.
>springboot schedulers
>All banks uses "Quartz" Scheduler.this is the market
leader
>Even though springboot provides scheduling capabilities
we use quartz for better output
>we need to add quartz libraries into springboot
http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/
>apache is handling quartz

to use sheduler we use

To clean install project in command prompt
------------------------------------
Go to cmd then to switch workspace 
   d:

then enter cd location from properties location,then click enter.

mvnw clean install
when we clean install project it will download 
dependencies and package to war or jar

MICROSERVICES
---------------------------------
to design a microservice following are prerequites

webservices
swagger
Devops tools
 
JNDI-java naming director 
 
SOA-service oriented architecture
hardware and cost is high
to overcome above  webservices are came
 
interoperability-the ability of computer systems or 
software to exchange and make use of information.

webservice is classified into 2 types
Rest
soap

Webservices------>
SOAP---Slow,becuase soap uses XML,Security is very good,It supports diffrent protocols.

New customer or new projects are not adopting SOAP,instead they are using REST.

REST---Fast,security is moderate,Http/https protocol.

OAKTA framework,SSO techniqs like Json token,Oauth1.0,OAuth2.x,Kerberos,LDAP authientication....etc

Consumer--read/fetch the data from Producer using Http/https
Consumer shld know the Endpoint URL.

@Conditional
------------------------------
@Conditiononproperty(name=DB,value="MYSQL")
when we have multiple db's if we need to call one
db then we use  @Conditiononproperty
not only DB's any meta data in in application.properties
we can call using @Conditiononproperty 
This concept is called as condition flow
we can use this on beans and application.properties


Object Graph
--------------------------------------------
spring boot uses object graph mechanism to load 
component into memory

Synchronous and Asynchronous
----------------------------
for microservice,networking --asysnchronous
for component microservice--synchronous

processor--os--process-threads

multiple threads do multiple work simulanteously
by default threads will work on asynchronous mechanism

process creation is heavy weight 
thread creation is light weight

the class with main method is called main thread

Threads are 2 types
predefined-under the controller of JVM
userdefined-under the controller of Developer


below are ways to implement threads in class
-----------
1)extend thread
2)implements runnable -- it is called as functional interface
an interface with only one abstract method is called as 
functional interface

flush and commit are similiar the only difference is
commit will push entire data to db directly
flush will push entire data to session obj and from 
their it push to db

When we establish session a thread is created for every 
session

forground  threads-runs in foreground and visble 
backgound threads --called as daemon threads --which runs 
in background and not visible
disc and execution monitor

Threads  can be assigned with priority like high,medium
and low

javap java.lang.object

notify,notifyall and wait

All the threads will under the control of object 

LOCKING
-------------------------------------------
if two threads wants to use same resource there is chance 
to collide this is  called dead locks
mutex
semaphore

locking mechanism is used to prevent from dead locks
 
race condition--dead locks--it will violate acid properterties
and integrity issuess,if we are using Database

Locking mechanism 
t1,t2,t3
int a=90;
a=a+1;

Types of Locking mechanisms
----------------------
Optimistic Locking mechanisms
Pessimistic Locking mechanisms
these two mechanism can avoid  dirty reeds and phantom reeds

Thread pool is a pool of thread objects which can be 
configured as a dynamic pool or fixed pool
this is controlled by threadexecutor or executor class.

No two processor have same id

Reflection or introspection --process of knowing predefined 
methods of any class in command prompt


placeholder in html
date picker
drop downlist -- single and multiselect
submit vs button tag
html validations -- required
images

audio and video using html -- manual controll and 
automatic controll --audio/video control
flash screen
handling 
horizontal/verticle bar
frames


[5:27 PM] Srinivas (Guest)
When you call session.flush(), the statements are executed in database but it will not committed.

If you don’t call session.flush() and if you call session.commit() , internally commit() method executes the statement and commits.
[5:37 PM] Srinivas (Guest)
commit()= flush+commit.

Disadvantages
---------------------
>>not secure--overcome by--(Can be handled by json tokens and other security mechanisms)
>>js doesn't support desktop app development
>>doesn't support all oops features--overcome by-- (upgrade us js to ES7 or ES8 version)
>>multithreading is not supported--overcome by--  (Nodejs)
>>doesn't support NIO(non io) operations--overcome by-- (Nodejs)
>>Cannot create network based apps --overcome by--(Nodejs)

---
The @EnableAsync annotation switches on Spring’s ability 
to run @Async methods in a background thread pool.

to create threadpool,we need to use ThreadPoolExecutor class


Enabling Async in springboot
1) Add @Aysnc before the methods which shld run in 
asynchronous methods
2)Method in step1 shld return completablefuture
3)step2 methods shld be always public
4)Enable @EnableAsync in configuration file in project
5)run the application
Note:AEnableAsync will autodetect the methods which are 
annotated with @Ayns automatically
@Enable Async will use ThreadPool to assign thread to 
perform Asynonous communication
using threadpool executor class

@ConditionalOnResource --only to load neccesary beans 

can be applied on properties,beans


Using @Conditional,main advantage is we can avoid 
unnecessary loading of beans into memory;So that we can 
save memory space and CPU time,Which leads to faster 
application response.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object

oops in js
--------------
class <classname>
{
//constructors
//function
}

syntax for constructor
constructor() {
}

to declare function inside the class the syntax is 
abcd() {
}

if function is outside the class the syntax is 
function abcd() {
}

to create obj in class the syntax is 
var f= new Calculator();
f.abcd();

class Calculator 
{
    constructor(a) {
        console.log("constructor is invoked"+a);
    }
   static abcd() 
    {
        console.log("abcd invoked")
    }
}
var f=new Calculator(45);
f.abcd();
output: "constructor is invoked45"
"abcd invoked"

Question
---------------
1)declare class level variable ES6

class Calculator 
{
a1=90;
    constructor(a1) {
        console.log("constructor is invoked"+this.a1);
    }
   static abcd() 
    {
        console.log("abcd invoked")
    }
}
var f=new Calculator(45);
f.abcd();
output: "constructor is invoked90"
"abcd invoked"

inheritance
--------------
class Calculator 
{
    constructor(a) {
        console.log("constructor is invoked"+a);
    }
  abcd() 
    {
        console.log("abcd invoked")
    }
}
class Child extends Calculator
{
display() {
console.log("display invoked from child")
}
}
var obj=new Child()
obj.abcd();
obj.display();
output: "constructor is invoked45"
"abcd invoked"
"display invoked from childe"


>>ES6 doesn't support multiple inheritance


>>A class in js can have only one constructor
and methods can be any number
and methods can be overloaded in js

class Calculator
{
constructor(a)
{
console.log("Empty Constructor invoked"+a);
}
display()
{
console.log("display invoked");
}
 
abcd()
{
console.log('abcd invoked from parent');
}
abcd(a)
{
console.log('abcd paarmeterised invoked');
}
 
}
class Child extends Calculator
{
display()
{
console.log("display invoked from Child");
}
display()
{
console.log('display invoked from child');
}
}
var obj = new Calculator();
obj.display();

Object Api in js
--------------

where ever we see prototype in js code that means 
ur working prototype js

types of js
---------
functional js
object js
protoytpe js

protype js
Object.create()
---------------------
function Car (desc) {
 this.desc = desc;
 this.color = "red";
}
Car.prototype = {
 getInfo: function() {
 return 'A ' + this.color + ' ' + this.desc + '.';
 }
};
//instantiate object using the constructor function
var car = Object.create(Car.prototype);
car.color = "blue";
alert(car.getInfo());  


the first function in above program is treated as class
in prototype js 
so getinfo fun is called

object.defineproperties()
-------
var obj = {};
Object.defineProperties(obj, {
 'property1': {
 value: true,
 writable: true
 },
 'property2': {
 value: 'Hello',
 writable: false
 }
// etc. etc.
})

property assignment way of function declaration
-----------------------------------------
var obj1={
    sum:function add(n1,n2) {
        return n1+n2 }
}
obj1.sum(2,3);
o/p:5 
obj1={

const s1 = "2 + 2"; // creates a string primitive
const s2 = new String("2 + 2"); // creates a String object
console.log(eval(s1)); // returns the number 4
console.log(eval(s2)); // returns the string "2 + 2"



charAt method of String
----------------------
var sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';

var index = 4;

console.log(`The character at index ${index} is ${sentence.charAt(index)}`);
// Expected output: "The character at index 4 is q"
o/p:"The character at index 4 is q"

AJAX
-----------
asynchronous javascript and xml --AJAX

Browser---Internet---Server----Internet----Browser

1)ajax is used for asynchronous commounication
2)from frontend you want to pull data from backend
3)for consuming webservices asynchronously

react+ajax
react+promise
react+jquery+ajax

AJAX steps
------------------
1)event should be created either by selection or by 
clicking button
2)create an xml http request object
3)open the session with server
4)once the connection is established,send request obj
to server
5)once server receives the data,it will process it 
and then gives the output to browser(requester).


>>Ajax will read data from url provided by developer 
or end user
>>Using ajax we need to perform necessary transformation
and consume the same and display it on browser.
>>Different browser will have different request objects 
ie..ActivexObject for windows(microsoft)

no need to maintain any order in code we can declare 
method first and after that we can create a class

0: request not initialized
1: server connection established
2: request received
3: processing request
4: request finished and response is ready

promise:used for mainly asynchronous 
communication
promise is part of js of ES6 ver
there are two states or methods
successfull, failure
success and failure in js is called 
callback
and this are called automatically by 
framework
A task cannot be executed without thread 
thread is controlled by os and os is 
controlled by processor

While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.
When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.

myPromise.state myPromise.result
pending : working result is undefined
success : returns value
failure : returns an error object

syntax for promise:
let myPromise = new Promise(function(myResolve, myReject) {
// "Producing Code" (May take some time)
 
  myResolve(); // when successful
  myReject();  // when error
});
 
// "Consuming Code" (Must wait for a fulfilled Promise)
myPromise.then(
  function(value) { /* code if successful */ },
  function(error) { /* code if some error */ }
);

a func without name is called anonymous
in js we can pass func as parameter to func
which is not possible in java
promise also have status code to know status 
of the promise

we can use vs code,sublime,brackets for 
frontend development

command pallet in vs code will give the 
suggesstions

observations:
=====================
>>default parameters shld not be clubbedt
with callbacks
>>when we want to call a function from script
tag, then that script tag shld be writtened
in<body>
>>callbacks shld be passed as a parameter to 
a function where it is necessary ie especially
for network programs,db programs...etc.
>>we used exception handling.try,catch,
finally blocks
>>failure and success callbacks wiil be called 
based on the condition, for example operation
success,server responded with 200 status...
>>order of calling funtion ie function order 
in JS.


>>>Object destruction in JS:
-----------------------------------
const a= {
    "name":"sai",
    "empid":45
    };
	const {name,empid}=a;
	console.log(name,age);
	
simplify the way of calling properties from 
object.
if properties are more calling properties 
using alert increase process at backside 
this can be overcomed by using object destruction


tasks:
-Arrow functions--practice
JSON.stringfy
JSON.parse
Date api
string api
ways of function declaring
object api


JSON.stringify
----------------------
console.log(JSON.stringify({ x: 5, y: 6 }));
// Expected output: '{"x":5,"y":6}'

console.log(
  JSON.stringify([new Number(3), new String('false'), new Boolean(false)]),
);
// Expected output: '[3,"false",false]'

console.log(JSON.stringify({ x: [10, undefined, function () {}, Symbol('')] }));
// Expected output: '{"x":[10,null,null,null]}'

console.log(JSON.stringify(new Date(2006, 0, 2, 15, 4, 5)));
// Expected output: '"2006-01-02T15:04:05.000Z"'
VM30:1 {"x":5,"y":6}
VM30:4 [3,"false",false]
VM30:9 {"x":[10,null,null,null]}
VM30:12 "2006-01-02T09:34:05.000Z"


json representation
{
"key1": value,
"key2":value
}

json.parce()
---------------------
const json = '{"result":true, "count":42}';
const obj = JSON.parse(json);

console.log(obj.count);
// Expected output: 42





console.log(obj.result);
// Expected output: true


Spreadoperator
----------------------
>>in js if we want to combine multiple array 
objects /collections, we can use spread 
operator

syntax:  ...<array/variable naem>
three .'s is the syntax for spreadoperator

var a = [11,22,33,44];
var b = [55,66,77];
var d = [...a,...b]
console.log(d);

Rest operator
--------------
function add(...a) {
	console.log(a);
}
add(22);
add(33,234);

o/p:
> Array [22]
> Array [33, 234]

react.js
-----------
node.js
vs code
chrome is prefered browser

Technical 
------------
ES6 or typescript
promise
arrays
String api
json.stringify
strict mode
babel
bag
optimistic and pessimistic locking
virtual DOM
DOM

node version
--------------
https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v16.x/node-v16.20.2-win-x64.zip
16.20.2
https://github.com/kolaparthisrini/ReactJS/blob/main/REACT_Node_Commands.pdf
node ver -- 16.20.2
npm ver -- 8.


npm install -g eslint
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g babel

npm install –g create-react-app
go to environment variables and set node path
exit the existing cmd and open new cmd
mkdir reacthelloworld
cd reacthelloworld
npx create-react-app hello-world-example

cls

cd hello-world-example
npm start

below are the four main pillars of react js
---------------------------------
strict mode
ES6 or typescript
modules
virtual DOM

doesn't throw any compilation errors
js--->throws silent errors
to overcome this enable strict mode used if we enable this 
it checks line by line if any error occurs it show errors

enabling strict mode stops the execution of program when 
compilation error occurs

>>MODULE
-------------
it is like package in java
import --use this if we want to use particular module
export -- making module public 
a module shld be exported to use in another module

module can be predefined ,userdefined

Virtual DOM
----------------------------------------------------
every browser deafult have dom called browser dom
Browser DOM -- tree structure
window
 document
   form
if we want to modify the webpage at any time or runtime 
on any node, it is very easy DOM trees.

document.body.style.background='red'

adding something to the available tree is called rendering
the above process in normal dom is takes more time and cpu
to overcome this virtual dom came into existance.

var a=[1,3];
var b=[1,2,3];

the above in normal dom creates separate tree when add 
something  to existing one
but in virtual dom is addsor rendering to existing one

rendering means updating

Reconsillation

https://dom-treemap.en.softonic.com/chrome/extension
https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dom-node-tree-viewer/jbplakkefflidgnjhckoahendgekokfc

add dom node tree extension in chrome to see dom tree 
of any website

RENDERING: Updating changes to Webpage is called as RENDERING.
or making changes to a webpage is called as rendering

DOM are of 3 types
DOM,Virtual DOM,Shadow DOM

virtual dom is light weight version of DOM
>>in React ,react is powered with LIVE-RELOAD server.
default port no will be 3000

npm run build====>for production purpose
npm start====>for DEVlopment purpose

>>webpack: it takes the responsibility to package your 
project (packaging).
localhost is not allowed in projects instead we need 
to use IPV4 address
>>ipconfig is command to check ip address

package.json in react is similar pom.xml file in maven 
when we issue npm install <dependencyname> on cmd,then npm 
will also update

npm repository is used to download any dependencies
in react.
https://www.npmjs.com/

when u add any dependency in package.json u need to 
update it in cmd by going folder location using below 
command
>>command:  npm update

>>yarn is alternative to npm
https://yarnpkg.com/  

git init
git add *
git commit -m "gyav"

in java, dependencies are will be in jar format
in react, dependencies are will be in module format

>>
>>in java, 3rd party dependencies will be in jar format.
>>in javascript/frontend, when we want use any 3rd party 
libraries, then we need include that library in code using
script tag
<script src="library name"/>
libraries will be in .js format

in js, to include any 3rd party library, we can use types
minimized version(Ex:popper.min.js) -- will occupy less memory
normal version(Ex:popper.js) -- will occupy more memory.

robots.txt: robots make your application available or 
searchable for search engine,if your app is in your cloud
the synonym of browser is user agent

state in component 
----------------------
Conventions of Using State in React: 
The state of a component should prevail throughout its 
lifetime, thus we must first have some initial state, to do
so we should define the State in the constructor of the 
component’s class.
The state should never be updated explicitly. React uses an 
observable object as the state that observes what changes 
are made to the state and helps the component behave 
accordingly.
React provides its own method setState(). setState() method 
takes a single parameter and expects an object which should 
contain the set of values to be updated. Once the update is 
done the method implicitly calls the render() method to 
repaint the page. Hence, the correct method of updating 
the value of a state will be similar to the code below. 
State updates should be independent. The state object of a 
component may contain multiple attributes and React allows 
to use setState() function to update only a subset of 
those attributes as well as using multiple setState() 
methods to update each attribute value independently.
The only time we are allowed to define the state explicitly is in the constructor to provide the initial state.

>>state is not applicable for the components that we create 
using function, state works only for components that we 
create using class but from latest react,ie from 16 onwards 
even for functional apprioach we achieve state using "hooks" 
concept

>>to change state values dynamically, we need to use below method
setState()

JSX
var d={'a':'aas'}
d.aa

https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html

<h1 align="rigth"/>

function iconChange() {
setTimeout(function(){ document.getElementById("icon").href = "/image1.png";}, 333);
setTimeout(function(){ document.getElementById("icon").href = "/image2.png";}, 667);
setTimeout(function(){ document.getElementById("icon").href = "/image.png";}, 1000);  
}

React routing
-------------
npx create-react-app reactrouting example

npm install react-router-dom --save
command to install routing

npm install bootstrap --save

https://tailwindcss.com/

1)Add routing dependencies
2)create components
3)In App.js
<Routes>
<Route>

Ways to install jenkins
-------------------
using war file
using usinh jenkins installer
using docker
using any web/application servers
using vm
on cloud

dont use installer to download jenkins in development

use docker to download jenkins it is best

jenkins will have default server called winstone

DevOps
-------------------------------------
development and operation
is a culture where two collabarte teams worktogether 
to achieve target 
http:splunk ---website to learn devops

CI CD CM combinely is called devops
CI-continuos integration --Dev
CD-continuos Development --oper
CM-continuos Monitoring --oper
CT-continuos Testing --Dev

Configuration management:
Ansible,chef,puppet are configuration management tools
Ansible is market leader

if project follows agile/scrum methodology then 
use devops
it not suitable for waterfall methodology

Swagger
-----------------
is a tool 
swagger is now part of OPENAPI

gives us tool to test restfull service
and it gives tool to design document for restfull service
we can design API specification

Design--what should be the response,what shld be the 
schema,what fields are to be inserted and mapping 
parameters


https://github.com/kolaparthisrini/ErrorApps


jenkins drawbacks
--------------------------------------
we cannot create roles directly
we cannot create bulk users at a time
As 1 and 2 points are but possible we can assign 
permission to users
But if we want to achieve the above,we need to relay 
on security plugins in jenkins like matrix authorization
strategy.

LDAP+Jenkins
SSO(single sign on)--through which we can login into 
multiple webisites using same credentials
token:this token wil act as authenticator between 
application
Authorization:checks whether it have required perimissions
Authentication:checks the users is valid or not
Every token will have expiry time

once if the token expires,we cannot continue with same
token,we need to fetch new token from issuer

TO design an app using SSO,we need to use below tools:
Oakta framework
Oauth 1.0/2.0
SAML -- complicated--but more secure--costly
Kerberos
Json tokens...etc
https://jwt.io/

plugin---Role based authorization strategy

Bydefault jenkins will act as master node
in projects devops engineer creates a cluster for 
jenkins
CLuster means it is a group of machine/servers/
terminals/node
>To create a cluster we need to have atleast one machine
Aws is a cloud provider 
 https://calculator.aws/#/

IAM--Identity access management 
through IAM create/delete users,create policies,assign 
policies,delete,role creation,assigning roles,password 
rules creation,password setting,aws user creation reports

EC2--Elastic cloud compute
AMI--amazon machine image
AWS had modified existing open source operating systems 
and released into the market as AMI

AWS linux AMI
AWS--to work on aws linux is mandatory

VM--network,internet,ipaddress,portno,storage,security
To perform any operations on cloud,we need to have 
atleast 1VPC(virtual private cloud)

Vpc gives below
IP adress assigning
port numbers
subnet address
routing to rigth node
security rules/firewall rules...etc

Inbound---Outbound
>>Every protocol in networking will have port no.
http:8080
https:8443
FTP:
SMTP:
AFTP:
POP:
SSH:Secure Shell

>>To access any VM from any cloud we can follow below 
ways
Using browser
USing Putty/puttygentools
Using AWS Api
Using AWS CLI


EBS(Elastic block storage)

Install Java (Amazon Linux 2023):

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo dnf install java-17-amazon-corretto -y
Install Jenkins:

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum install jenkins -y
Enable the Jenkins service to start at boot:

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl enable jenkins
Start Jenkins as a service:

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl start jenkins
You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl status jenkins

An Sample Application Delpoyment in EBS:
-----------------------------------------
- Open Aws 
	- Create an EBS environment
	- giev App name
	- Choose platform---Tomcat
	- next
	- Create a EC2 role 
		- Duplicate the browser tab
			- right click on exixting tab---duplicate
			- Open IAM
			- Create roles
				- create role
				- choose service--EC2
				- choose Permission policies
					- AWSElasticBeanstalkCustomPlatformforEC2Role
					- AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier
				- give the role name
				- choose create role
			- Create a EC2 Instance role
				- same as above but choose below policies
				- Choose Permission policies
					- EBS MultiDockerContainer
					- EBS Web Tier
					- EBS Worker Tier
				- choose Create role
		- In EBS tab
			- Choose existing service role
			- choose EC2 role,key pair,EC2 Instance role that you created before
			- next
			- Choose VPC
			- Public---activated
			- Instance Subnets---choose any two
			- next
			- In EC2 Security groups 
				- Select the launch-wizard that you created recently
			- next-->next-->submit
			- Click on domian--- output of the app wil be displayed
To Delete the EBS Env:
----------------------
- EBS
	- In Applications
		- select the env you created, actions-->delete 
		- got to environments--> here we can check whether the env is deleted or not
		- goto EC2
			- Elastic IPs
				- Select the env-->actions-->disassociate
										  ---> release

light weight of vm container
		
h/w------hypervisor-----vm
hypervisor acts as a mediator	
EC2---is a virtual server or instance

>>containers uses linux it doesn't support linux

In previous  if we want to install multiple os in one system we need VM
But from window 10 it provides a feature WSLT which supports all linux
commands

Docker by default gives container engine which creates container
container implement is provides by docker
container is a environment where we can run app in isolation mode

>>Docker/mesos/kubernates ---container services

docker hub is similar to maven repositary
in docker hub every thing is in image format but in maven dependencies 
in jar format

sudo docker ps
ls
cat Dockerfile
sudo docker pull sonarqube



>VM are heavy weight because of Hypervisor and evry app will 
have its own o/s.
>In docker,we dint have hypervisor,we do have "Container 
engine.
>Container enginer is responsible for controlling the 
lifecycle of container.
>In docker ,Container engine is main component that is 
responsible to run ur app.
>Docker uses "Dockerfile" to run java app.SO,evry java app shld
be embedded with Docker file.
>When we use docker,first we need to convert your code to image
(like jar).To do this we need to build project first using docker build.
>Once converted,we need to run the image,so that that image will be 
executed in container.Other wise without run we cann view the 
output.(docker run <> <>)
 
docker ps---to view current running containers
docker images---to view current images in docker
docker run--to run an image to container
docker build---will convert ur code to image
 
>>In docker any app shld run in container ie whether it is .net,python,java.....
>Like Maven repo,for docker,we have docker hub.
>We can also push our own userdefined images to docker hub using docker push.
>Docker file will not have any extension.
file shld be like below:
Dockerfile
>docker stop <containerid> will stop ur running container.

>Docker file consists of instructions that shld be executed 
by your docker engine before converting to image 

Ec2--Docker--Container(springboot)
Containers uses VM concepts on backend. To install docker 
s/w on laptops or computers,we need to first install VM.

>>To install docker,we need to enable virtualization at OS 
level

Maven--build
Github--code repositary

In AWS
--------------
code commit----similar to Github
code Build----similar to Maven build
code Delpoyment---EC2
code Artifact----similar like JFrog/Sonartype Nexus
code pipeline
code guru---similar to sonarqube 
To store code or any files, we can also use aws s3 bucket

AWS had come with AWS toolkit for developers .Using  this 
toolkit we can push/deploy/write/modify code directly 
from the IDE like Eclipse,vscode,Intellij
